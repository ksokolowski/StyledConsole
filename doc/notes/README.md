## Purpose

These files document the decision-making process and provide historical context but are not required for implementation. The core SDD documents are:

- **../SPECIFICATION.md** - User requirements and success criteria
- **../PLAN.md** - Technical architecture and design
- **../TASKS.md** - Implementation breakdown with progress tracking
- **../EMOJI-STRATEGY.md** - Emoji support strategy
- **../CSS4-COLORS.md** - Color reference guide

## Usage

Reference these notes when:
- Understanding why certain decisions were made
- Looking up specific UV commands
- Reviewing the library rename process
- Understanding user story patterns

Do not edit these files during implementation - they are historical records.
